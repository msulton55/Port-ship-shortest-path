# Port-ship-shortest-path
Shortest path to find one port/dock to another port using Dijkstra Algorithm.

*The program is still in development project*

## Main feature
The program basically will find the shortest path by utilizing Dijkstra Algorithm. This program using latitude and longitude input to
calculate the distance in KM using Havensin theorm. After get calculation by Dijkstra, the program will show the result in a map.

## External library
[JXBrowser](https://jxbrowser-support.teamdev.com/)

## Under development
  1. Developing the front-end map by using Google Map API 
  2. Integrating the backend: algorithm and the google map
